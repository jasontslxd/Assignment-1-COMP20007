# Add or update any of these rules to include additional files/modules you may
# include. You can add additional compiler flags as well, however you should
# not remove the -Wall flag.

# This .PHONY command declares the "clean" rule as a phony one, i.e., it means
# that the clean rule will run instructions but it wont create a file called
# "clean" like a normal rule would (e.g., the util.o rule results in a file
# called util.o being created).
.PHONY: clean

clean:
	rm *.o
	rm a1
